description: How to configure your BeeBuddy experience level, units, and display preferences.
---

BeeBuddy adapts its interface to your experience level and location. Adjust
your preferences in the **Settings** tab at any time — changes take effect
immediately without restarting the app.

## Available Preferences

| Setting | Options | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Experience Level** | Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced | Controls which fields appear on inspection forms |
| **Units** | Metric / Imperial | Affects temperature and weight display throughout the app |
| **Hemisphere** | Northern / Southern / Auto | Adjusts seasonal context used by AI recommendations |
| **Theme** | System / Light / Dark | Sets the app color scheme |

## Experience Level in Detail

The experience level setting changes how much detail the inspection form
asks for:

- **Beginner** — Shows only the most essential fields: queen sighted, eggs
  present, population estimate, honey stores, and colony temperament. Ideal
  for new beekeepers who don't yet need to record every metric.
- **Intermediate** — Adds brood pattern scoring, frame counts, pest signs,
  and pollen stores. Suitable for beekeepers comfortable with a full
  inspection routine.
- **Advanced** — Unlocks all fields including number of supers, disease
  indicators, and varroa mite count. Designed for experienced beekeepers
  and those following the full BEEP data model.

Changing your experience level only affects future inspection forms.
Existing inspection records are never altered.
