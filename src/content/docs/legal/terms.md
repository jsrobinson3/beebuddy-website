## AI Recommendations

The AI-powered recommendations are provided for informational purposes only.
They are **not** a substitute for professional beekeeping advice or veterinary

## Bee Health Research Program

BeeBuddy offers a voluntary program that shares de-identified beekeeping data
with researchers working to improve bee health and pollinator ecosystems.

- **Opt-in required** — participation is entirely voluntary. You must explicitly
  opt in through your account settings before any of your data is included.
- **De-identified data** — all personally identifiable information is removed
  before data is shared. You cannot be identified from the research data set.
- **Opt out at any time** — you may withdraw from the program at any time
  through your account settings. Once you opt out, your data will not be included
  in future research data sets.
- **No commercial use** — research data is provided to researchers free of
  charge and is not sold or licensed for commercial purposes.
- **Researcher obligations** — researchers who receive data must agree not to
  attempt to re-identify individuals and must use the data solely for bee health
  and ecosystem research.

By opting in, you acknowledge that de-identified data shared with researchers
cannot be recalled from studies already in progress or published results at the
time of your withdrawal.

For full details on what data is shared and how it is de-identified, see our
[Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy/).

make reasonable efforts to notify you of significant changes.

## Intellectual Property
