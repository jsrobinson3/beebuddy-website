title: Privacy Policy
description: How BeeBuddy collects, uses, and protects your information.
---

**Effective date:** February 23, 2026

BeeBuddy ("we", "us", or "our") operates the BeeBuddy application and the
[beebuddyai.com](https://beebuddyai.com) website. This Privacy Policy explains
what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding that
information.

## Information We Collect

### Information you provide

- **Account information** — email address, display name, and authentication
  credentials when you create an account.
- **Beekeeping data** — apiaries, hives, inspection logs, and photos you enter
  into the application.

### Information collected automatically

- **Usage data** — pages visited, features used, and general interaction
  patterns.
- **Device information** — device type, operating system, and browser type.
- **Log data** — IP address, access times, and referring URLs when you visit our
  website.

### Self-hosted instances

If you self-host BeeBuddy, your data stays entirely on your own infrastructure.
This policy applies only to the hosted service at beebuddyai.com.

## How We Use Your Information

We use collected information to:

- Provide, operate, and maintain the BeeBuddy service.
- Generate AI-powered recommendations based on your inspection data.
- Improve and develop new features.
- Communicate service updates and respond to support requests.
- Monitor for security issues and prevent abuse.

## AI Processing

When you use the AI recommendations feature, relevant inspection data may be
sent to a third-party large-language-model provider to generate suggestions. We
send only the minimum data needed to produce a recommendation. Review the
[AI Recommendations guide](/guides/ai-recommendations/) for details on supported
providers and how to choose a local model for fully offline processing.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell your personal information. We may share information only in
these circumstances:

- **Service providers** — third-party services that help us operate (hosting,
  analytics, AI model providers), bound by confidentiality obligations.
- **Legal requirements** — when required by law, regulation, or valid legal
  process.
- **Safety** — to protect the rights, safety, or property of BeeBuddy, our
  users, or the public.

## Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to
provide the service. You may request deletion of your account and associated data
at any time by contacting us.

## Security

We use industry-standard measures to protect your data, including encryption in
transit (TLS) and at rest. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure,
so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:

- Access the personal data we hold about you.
- Correct inaccurate data.
- Request deletion of your data.
- Export your data in a portable format.
- Object to or restrict certain processing.

To exercise any of these rights, contact us using the information below.

## Children's Privacy

BeeBuddy is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect
personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected
such information, please contact us so we can delete it.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
material changes by posting the updated policy on this page and updating the
effective date.
