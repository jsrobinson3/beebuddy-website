title: Privacy Policy
description: How BeeBuddy collects, uses, and protects your information.
---

**Effective date:** February 23, 2026

BeeBuddy ("we", "us", or "our") operates the BeeBuddy application and the
[beebuddyai.com](https://beebuddyai.com) website. This Privacy Policy explains
what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding that
information.

## Information We Collect

### Information you provide

- **Account information** — email address, display name, and authentication
  credentials when you create an account.
- **Beekeeping data** — apiaries, hives, inspection logs, and photos you enter
  into the application.

### Information collected automatically

- **Usage data** — pages visited, features used, and general interaction
  patterns.
- **Device information** — device type, operating system, and browser type.
- **Log data** — IP address, access times, and referring URLs when you visit our
  website.

### Self-hosted instances

If you self-host BeeBuddy, your data stays entirely on your own infrastructure.
This policy applies only to the hosted service at beebuddyai.com.

## How We Use Your Information

We use collected information to:

- Provide, operate, and maintain the BeeBuddy service.
- Generate AI-powered recommendations based on your inspection data.
- Improve and develop new features.
- Communicate service updates and respond to support requests.
- Monitor for security issues and prevent abuse.

## AI Processing

When you use the AI recommendations feature, relevant inspection data may be
sent to a third-party large-language-model provider to generate suggestions. We
send only the minimum data needed to produce a recommendation. Review the
[AI Recommendations guide](/guides/ai-recommendations/) for details on supported
providers and how to choose a local model for fully offline processing.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell your personal information. We may share information only in
these circumstances:

- **Service providers** — third-party services that help us operate (hosting,
  analytics, AI model providers), bound by confidentiality obligations.
- **Legal requirements** — when required by law, regulation, or valid legal
  process.
- **Safety** — to protect the rights, safety, or property of BeeBuddy, our
  users, or the public.
- **Bee Health Research Program** — if you opt in, de-identified data may be
  shared with researchers as described below.

## Bee Health Research Program

BeeBuddy offers a voluntary research-sharing program designed to support
scientific efforts to promote the health of bees and pollinator ecosystems.

### How it works

- **Opt-in only** — this program is entirely voluntary. No data is shared with
  researchers unless you explicitly opt in through your account settings. You may
  opt out at any time, and we will stop including your data in future research
  data sets.
- **De-identification** — before any data is shared, all personally identifiable
  information (PII) is removed. This includes your name, email address, account
  identifiers, precise location coordinates, and any other information that could
  reasonably be used to identify you. Apiary locations are generalized to a
  regional level only.
- **What is shared** — de-identified beekeeping data such as inspection logs,
  hive health observations, environmental conditions, and aggregated trends.
- **Who receives the data** — qualified researchers and academic institutions
  conducting studies related to bee health, pollinator conservation, and
  ecosystem sustainability.
- **No charge to researchers** — research data is provided to researchers at no
  cost. BeeBuddy does not monetize this data in any way.
- **No re-identification** — researchers who receive data must agree not to
  attempt to re-identify any individuals from the de-identified data set.
- **Transparency** — we may publish a list of research projects that have
  received data through this program so you can see how your contributions are
  making an impact.

## Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to
provide the service. You may request deletion of your account and associated data
at any time by emailing [info@beebuddyai.com](mailto:info@beebuddyai.com). See
[Data Deletion Requests](#data-deletion-requests) for details.

## Security

We use industry-standard measures to protect your data, including encryption in
transit (TLS) and at rest. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure,
so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:

- Access the personal data we hold about you.
- Correct inaccurate data.
- Request deletion of your data.
- Export your data in a portable format.
- Object to or restrict certain processing.

To exercise any of these rights, email us at
[info@beebuddyai.com](mailto:info@beebuddyai.com).

## Data Deletion Requests

In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California
Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other applicable data protection laws, you have
the right to request the deletion of your personal data.

### How to delete your data

- **Self-service** — log into the BeeBuddy app, go to **Settings**, and select
  **Delete My Account**. This will immediately remove your account and all
  associated data.
- **Email** — if you are unable to log in, send an email to
  [info@beebuddyai.com](mailto:info@beebuddyai.com) with the email address
  associated with your account and we will make a best effort to process your
  request promptly.

### Scope of deletion

Upon request we will delete:

- Account information (email, display name, credentials).
- Beekeeping data (apiaries, hives, inspection logs, photos).
- Usage data and device information linked to your account.

We may retain limited data where required by law (e.g., financial transaction
records) or where necessary to protect our legal interests. Any retained data
will be restricted from further processing and deleted when the retention
obligation expires.

### Research program data

If you previously opted into the Bee Health Research Program, data that has
already been de-identified and shared with researchers cannot be recalled, as it
can no longer be linked to your identity. Opting out and requesting deletion will
prevent any future data from being included in the program.

## Children's Privacy

BeeBuddy is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect
personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected
such information, please email us at
[info@beebuddyai.com](mailto:info@beebuddyai.com) so we can delete it.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
material changes by posting the updated policy on this page and updating the
effective date.
